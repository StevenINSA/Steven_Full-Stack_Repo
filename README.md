# Steven_Full-Stack_Repo

Hello,

Welcome to my Full Stack repository for the Full Stack course at LUT University. The course is divided into 5 sections: 

  - NodeJS
  - MongoDB
  - ExpressJS
  - Angular
  - MEAN-stack

I created 4 branches accordingly to the course (MongoDB course only required some Terminal work). Thereby, you can check 
all the exercices completed by navigating through the branches. I moreover created a branch dedicated to the final MEAN-stack 
project, named MEAN_Project. 

Have a nice day!
