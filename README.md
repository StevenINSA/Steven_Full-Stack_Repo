# Steven_Full-Stack_Repo

Hello,

Welcome to my Full Stack repository for the Full Stack course at LUT University. The course is divided into 5 sections: 

  - NodeJS
  - MongoDB
  - ExpressJS
  - Angular
  - MEAN-stack

I then created 4 branches according to the course (MongoDB course only required some Terminal work so there is no code for it). Thereby, you can check all the exercices completed by navigating through the branches. As the MEAN project is highly based on the MEAN course, I didn't recreated another branch for it so you can find all the relative work by going to the MEAN_course branche. 

You can find the learning diary in the main branch as well.

Have a nice day!
